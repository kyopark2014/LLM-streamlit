 Here is the user documentation in wiki markdown format for the provided Python code:

# Overview

This Python code uses Streamlit to build a web application that generates agile user stories, data models, API specifications, and BDD scenarios from a given epic description. It utilizes several AWS services (S3, Comprehend) and AI models (Anthropic Claude) to generate the outputs.

# Usage

The web app provides the following functionality:

- User enters an epic description in the input text box
- User selects desired output language from the dropdown
- Four tabs are generated with the outputs:
  - User Stories 
  - Data Model
  - API Specifications
  - BDD Scenarios
- The outputs are generated by calling the Anthropic Claude AI model

# Code breakdown

## Imports and setup

The code first imports necessary libraries:

- `streamlit` for building the web app 
- `boto3` for connecting to AWS services
- `os` for environment variables
- `anthropic` for Claude AI model

It then initializes:

- AWS credentials, S3 client, Comprehend client
- Streamlit session state to store outputs
- Environment variables for AWS keys, Claude API key, etc.

## Streamlit UI

The Streamlit code creates the UI with:

- A header, input text box, and language dropdown 
- Four tabs to display each output
- Sample epic descriptions in the sidebar

## Generating outputs

The `GetAnswers` function takes the input text and calls Claude to generate the output text for user stories.

Similarly, other functions call Claude to generate the data model, API specs, and BDD scenarios based on the previous outputs. 

The generated text for each output is displayed in the relevant tab.

## Handling outputs

- The output text is processed to escape any `$` characters which can break markdown formatting
- If Claude returns no output, a default string is displayed
- The user stories and data model outputs are saved in `st.session_state` to pass them to subsequent calls
